# map-chat-bot
This is a very simple chat bot integrating with [MapChat](idoco.github.io/map-chat/).
It was built ontop [elizabot.js](http://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/) and uses [country-reverse-geocoding](https://github.com/totemstech/country-reverse-geocoding)
to greet new chatter acording to their location.
